# MachineLearningApps

Machine learning is a process that is widely used for prediction. N number of algorithms are available in various libraries which can be used for prediction.

Using Flask for the back-end engine, HTML for the front-end and using TechableMachine for keras model. I have made this Template Which Can Help Flask Beginer To Deploy a ML WebApp

This is An Example of a Flask WebApp that determines weather a person has Brain Tumor Through MRI Scans ([Brain Tumor Detector](https://mahirshah.pythonanywhere.com/webdev/brain_tumor_detector)). You can also run this.

#Instruction to Start
1. Goto https://mahirshah.pythonanywhere.com/webdev/brain_tumor_detector

2. Download Any Four Images.
   * ![Glicoma](https://github.com/MahirShah07/MachineLearningApps/blob/main/api/static/DataSet/Glioma/Te-glTr_0000.jpg)
   * ![Meningioma](https://github.com/MahirShah07/MachineLearningApps/blob/main/api/static/DataSet/Meningioma/Te-meTr_0001.jpg)
   * ![Pituitary](https://github.com/MahirShah07/MachineLearningApps/blob/main/api/static/DataSet/Glioma/Te-glTr_0000.jpg)
   * ![No Tumor](https://github.com/MahirShah07/MachineLearningApps/blob/main/api/static/DataSet/Pituitary/Te-piTr_0001.jpg)
   
5. Upload the Image.

6. Click Predict.
Disclamer: Please note that is for educational purposes do not take the results seriously, I suggest to consult docter with rqured qualification before getting any medicine or test. I do not reccomend using this for any industrial purpose. I do not garuntee any results from this website. Mahir Shah cannot be responisble for any damage casued to you.

# To Deploy it on local host:
1. Download Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads

2. Installing Python (If not already installed)
   * Install Python From its Website according to os requirement https://www.python.org/downloads/
   * Download pip
     For Windows: Open Command Promt<br />
     -------------$ cd C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310<br />
     -------------$ python get-pip.py<br />
     For Linux: $ sudo apt install python3-pip<br />
     For MacOS: Bro I really don't know this one<br />
   
3. Download the souce code. or 
   Open Terminal in Folder you want to copy and paste 
   * $ git clone https://github.com/MahirShah07/MachineLearningApps

4. Intalling all required python packages/library.
   * $ cd MachineLearningApps
   * $ pip install -r requrements.txt
   
5. Run index.py from this command.
   * $ cd api 
   * $ python index.py
   
6. And Boom Website is Hosted on your local host
   * Paste: [LocalHost](https://127.0.0.1:5000) - https://127.0.0.1:5000 in Your Brosure
   
# To depoly any hosting services.
To Deploy in hosting services like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/),etc.

1. Paste project link.
   * https://github.com/MahirShah07/MyWebsite
   
   Select Deploy it will clone project in your github account.
2. Then Just Change *app.json* to *<hosting_services>.json*

2. Start Depolyment of Website (in some cases it will do on it's own).

# Devlopment Takes a Ton of time 
   I would like to request you to please support me on:
   * Please Add My Name **Mahir Shah** in Your Website 
   * Include My Website: *https://mahirshah.pythonanywhere.com/*
   * And My Git Hub Project Link ie. https://github.com/MahirShah07/MachineLearningApps That you just downloaded
