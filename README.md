# MachineLearningApps

Machine learning is a process that is widely used for prediction. N number of algorithms are available in various libraries which can be used for prediction.

Using Flask for the back-end engine, HTML for the front-end and using TechableMachine for keras model. I have made this Template Which Can Help Flask Beginer To Deploy a ML WebApp

This is An Example of a Flask WebApp that determines weather a person has Brain Tumor Through MRI Scans. You can also run this.
